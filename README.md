## About the book

Microsoft Power Platform Enterprise Architecture offers an array of architectural best practices and techniques for any forward-looking enterprise architect or decision maker who wants to know more about integrating solutions to serve growing business needs. With this book, you’ll learn about the tools available in the Power Platform suite and identify which are appropriate for your business. Then, you’ll integrate them seamlessly with various other Microsoft 365 and Azure components.

Unlike many other overwhelmingly long and unstructured resources, this book covers essential concepts using one concise yet practical example that is revisited throughout the book. You’ll develop the skills you need to architect, design, and manage a complex solution as you follow the journey of a fictitious enterprise customer as they enter the world of Power Platform. Throughout the book, you’ll discover how to combine the functionality of Microsoft Power PI, Power Automate, Power Apps, and Power Virtual Agents with various methodologies to effectively address application lifecycle management, security, and extensibility. You'll also learn how to overcome common challenges in migrating data to and from Microsoft Power Platform using proven techniques.
